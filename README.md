# Wiki Engine with Lacinia and React

This project aims to create a flexible and accessible Wiki Engine using Lacinia for GraphQL API implementation and React for the frontend.

## Key Features

- **GraphQL API with Lacinia**: Create efficient and predictable queries for accessing required data.
- **ClojureScript with Reagent**: Build reactive user interfaces using ClojureScript and Reagent.
- **React Components**: Utilize React and React Router for creating dynamic user interfaces.
- **State Management with Apollo Client**: Manage application state effectively using Apollo Client.
- **Full-Text Search**: Utilize PostgreSQL's built-in full-text search functionality.
- **Testing**: Employ Jest and React Testing Library for effective unit and integration testing.
- **Translation**: Utilize Google Translate API to enable multi-language support.
- **Build and Compile**: Manage project dependencies using npm, Webpack, and Sass-loader for efficient builds.
- **Authentication and Security**: Implement JWT for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Secure Password Storage**: Utilize the buddy library for secure password hashing and salting.
- **Encryption**: Ensure data security through encryption mechanisms.
- **Accessibility**: Enhance accessibility with React-a11y, React-aria-modal, and Ally.js.
- **Clojure Backend**: Employ Compojure for routing and Ring for HTTP request/response handling.
- **Database**: Utilize PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **Code Management**: Manage Clojure project dependencies using Leiningen.
- **Live Reloading**: Utilize Figwheel for live reloading of ClojureScript code.
- **SQL Integration**: Harness the power of SQL using Hugsql.
- **YAML Support**: Incorporate js-yaml package for YAML data manipulation in ClojureScript.
